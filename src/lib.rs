//! A generated entity component system ðŸ¦Ž
//!
//! The gecs crate provides a compile-time generated, zero-overhead ECS for simulations
//! on a budget. Unlike other ECS libraries, gecs takes a full ECS world structure
//! definition from code and precompiles all queries to achieve better performance with
//! no upfront cost or caching overhead. Queries in gecs can be inspected and checked at
//! compile-time in order to catch what would otherwise be bugs presenting only in tests
//! or execution. However, this comes at the cost of requiring all archetypes to be known
//! and declared at compile-time, so that adding or removing components from entities at
//! runtime isn't currently possible -- hybrid approaches could solve this in the future.
//!
//! Archetypes in gecs can be set to contain a fixed capacity of entities. If all of the
//! archetypes in your ECS world declaration are configured in this way, gecs will perform
//! zero allocations after startup. This guarantees that your ECS world will adhere to a
//! known and predictable memory overhead for constrained environments (e.g. servers on
//! cloud instances). Attempting to create a new entity in a full archetype will return
//! `None` (no panic). Support for dynamically-sized archetypes with `Vec`-like storage
//! behavior is planned for support at a later date but is not currently implemented.
//!
//! The goals for gecs are (in descending priority order):
//! - Fast iteration and find queries
//! - Fast entity creation and destruction
//! - Low, predictable memory overhead
//! - A user-friendly library interface
//! - Simplicity and focus in features
//!
//! All of the code that gecs generates in user crates is safe, and users of gecs can
//! use `#[deny(unsafe_code)]` in their own crates. Note that gecs does use unsafe code
//! internally to allow for compiler optimizations around known invariants. It is not a
//! goal of this library to be written entirely in safe Rust.
//!

    /// Macro for declaring a new ECS world struct with archetype storage.
    ///
    /// The `ecs_world!` macro is used for declaring an ECS world data structure to populate
    /// and perform queries on. All types used in the ECS world must be known at compile-time,
    /// and the full structure of each archetype must be declared with the world. Components
    /// may not be added or removed from entities at runtime.
    ///
    /// Note that irrespective of capacity configuration, a single ECS archetype can hold at
    /// most `16,777,216` entities due to the encoding structure of the `Entity` type. For
    /// similar reasons, an ECS world can have only `255` distinct archetypes.
    ///
    /// The `ecs_world!` macro has several inner pseudo-macros used for declaring archetypes
    /// or performing other tasks such as naming the ECS world's data type. These are not true
    /// macros and have no purpose or meaning outside of the body of an `ecs_world!` declaration.
    ///
    /// ## ecs_name!
    ///
    /// ```ignore
    /// ecs_name!(Name);
    /// ```
    /// The `ecs_name!` inner pseudo-macro is used for setting the name (in PascalCase) of the
    /// ECS world struct. Without this declaration, the world's name will default to `World`.
    ///
    /// ## ecs_archetype!
    ///
    /// ```ignore
    /// ecs_archetype!(Name, capacity, Component, ...);
    /// ```
    /// The `ecs_archetype!` inner pseudo-macro is used for declaring an archetype in an ECS
    /// world. It takes the following arguments:
    ///
    /// - `Name`: The name (in PascalCase) of the archetype Rust type.
    /// - `capacity`: The capacity of the archetype, specified in one of the following ways:
    ///     - A constant expression (e.g. `200`, or `config::ARCH_CAPACITY + 4`). This will
    ///       create a fixed-size archetype that can contain only that number of entities.
    ///       Attempting to add an entity to a full archetype will return `None` (no panic).
    ///     - The `dyn` keyword here is currently reserved for near-future work implementing
    ///       dynamically sized archetypes. It is not supported in this version of the library.
    /// - `Component, ...`: One or more component types to include in this archetype. Because
    ///   generated archetypes are `pub` with `pub` members, all components must be `pub` too.
    ///
    /// The `ecs_archetype!` declaration supports the following attributes:
    ///
    /// - `#[cfg]` attributes can be used both on the `ecs_archetype!` itself, and on
    ///   individual component parameters.
    /// - `#[archetype_id(N)]` can be used to override an archetype's `TYPE_ID` value to `N`
    ///   (which must be between `1` and `255`). By default, archetype IDs start at 1 and count
    ///   up sequentially from the last value, similar to enum discriminants. No two archetypes
    ///   may have the same archetype ID (this is compiler-enforced).
    ///
